OV-chipkaart decoding tools
---------------------------

The OV-chipkaart is the Dutch RFID-based public transport ticketing system.
Each traveller needs an OV-chipkaart to travel. This package is an independent
decoder for the contents of these cards.

It is very much a work in progress, but it's useful already for reading travel
information. I hope that someday all this information will be fully open, and
that the card data will be accessible to their holders and the relevant
transport companies in a secure, transparent and privacy-respecting way.

  ovc-decode    Show a human-readable print of the transactions on a
                OV-chipkaart dump. To see station names instead of numbers,
                you need to run stations/createdb.py first.

  ovc-dump      Show a hexdump of an OV-chipkaart that fits on a large screen
                if you find that I missed something in the output, let me know

  dplay         Show text files consecutively on screen with differences
                marked by color. Useful for tracing sequential dumps.
		Use, for example, like:
                  for i in *.mfd; do ovc-dump $i >$i.dump; done; dplay *.dump


Thanks to all who have helped with this.
